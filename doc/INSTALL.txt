Noxim - the NoC Simulator
=========================

Installation instructions
-------------------------

This guide will show you how to install Noxim on your computer.


Supported Platforms
-------------------

Noxim is written using the C++ language and the SystemC library, so it is easily portable to
any platform for which SystemC is supported: please refer to their (SystemC) documentation to
know which they are. Just to let you know, we usually work under GNU/Linux (mainly Ubuntu)
but SystemC is known to run under other platforms including Apple Mac OS X and Sun Solaris
with GCC and Microsoft Windows with Visual C++ (but Cygwin with GCC is also known to work).

This document will then detail the steps required to build Noxim from the sources, including
the only prerequisite, i.e. the SystemC installation.


Prerequisite: SystemC installation
----------------------------------

- To compile SystemC you will obviously need a C++ compiler; if you still don't have it, on
  Debian/Ubuntu platforms you may install all the required tools with the following command:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential

- Download SystemC (currently at version 2.2.0) from http://www.systemc.org/downloads/standards/
  (a free registration is required).
- Unpack it; please note that some versions have a wrong file extension. For instance you may
  have to use the following commands to untar it:

    mv systemc-2.2.0.tgz systemc-2.2.0.tar
    tar xvf systemc-2.2.0.tar

- Enter the newly created directory and refer to the file INSTALL which details all the steps
  required for building. Basically they are:

    mkdir objdir
    cd objdir
    export CXX=g++
    ../configure
    make
    make install
    cd ..
    rm -rf objdir

- With modern versions of GCC you may find the "make" command above to fail with the
  following error message:

    ../../../../src/sysc/utils/sc_utils_ids.cpp: In function ‘int sc_core::initialize()’:
    ../../../../src/sysc/utils/sc_utils_ids.cpp:110: error: ‘getenv’ is not a member of ‘std’
    ../../../../src/sysc/utils/sc_utils_ids.cpp:111: error: ‘strcmp’ was not declared in this scope
    make[3]: *** [sc_utils_ids.o] Error 1
    make[3]: Leaving directory `/opt/systemc-2.2.0/objdir/src/sysc/utils'
    make[2]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
    make[2]: Leaving directory `/opt/systemc-2.2.0/objdir/src/sysc'
    make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
    make[1]: Leaving directory `/opt/systemc-2.2.0/objdir/src'
    make: *** [all-recursive] Error 1

  If this is your case (for instance it happens while compiling SystemC 2.2.0 with GCC 4.4),
  then please note that this is not a bug of the compiler but a bug in the SystemC sources,
  because they have forgot a couple of include clauses.
  To fix it, add the following includes at the top of file ../src/sysc/utils/sc_utils_ids.cpp :

    #include <cstdlib>
    #include <cstring>

  You may even modify that file without using any text editor, just use this shell command
  (yes, Fabrizio still loves UNIX shell!!!):

    sed -i '1 i #include <cstdlib>\n#include <cstring>' ../src/sysc/utils/sc_utils_ids.cpp

  Then restart from the "make" step in the list above.

  Once you have installed SystemC correctly, you may then jump to the next step.


Build SystemC
-------------

If SystemC is installed correctly, then you just have to compile Noxim.

1) Extract the source files and go to the "bin" directory.

2) In that directory edit the file Makefile.defs (NOT Makefile.deps!) to modify
the "SYSTEMC" environment variable according to your SystemC installation path.

3) Just run "make".

You may ignore warning messages (if any), so if you don't get any error you are
ready to run Noxim for the first time using the command:

    ./noxim

If everything works fine, it is now safe for you to copy or move this executable
elsewhere; if you are a maniac of cleaning please note that "make clean" will
also delete the executable... so move it before cleaning!

That's all, folks!
