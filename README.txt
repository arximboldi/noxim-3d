Noxim - the NoC Simulator
=========================

Welcome to Noxim, the Network-on-Chip Simulator developed at the University of Catania (Italy).
The Noxim simulator is developed using SystemC, a system description language based on C++, and
it can be downloaded from SourceForge under GPL license terms.

Noxim has a command line interface for defining several parameters of a NoC. In particular the
user can customize the network size, buffer size, packet size distribution, routing algorithm,
selection strategy, packet injection rate, traffic time distribution, traffic pattern, hot-spot
traffic distribution.

The simulator allows NoC evaluation in terms of throughput, delay and power consumption. This
information is delivered to the user both in terms of average and per-communication results.

In detail, the user is allowed to collect different evaluation metrics including the total number
of received packets/flits, global average throughput, max/min global delay, total energy consumption,
per-communications delay/throughput/energy etc.

The Noxim simulator is shipped along with Noxim Explorer, a tool useful during the design space
exploration phase. Infact, Noxim Explorer executes many simulations using Noxim in order to explore
the design space, and modifying the conÔ¨Åguration parameters for each simulation. Noxim Explorer will
create new configuration parameters for you, or complete the exploration according to the information
read from a script (known as exploration script or space file).
