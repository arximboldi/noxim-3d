  <p>Welcome to Noxim, the Network-on-Chip Simulator developed at the University of Catania (Italy).
  The Noxim simulator is developed using SystemC, a system description language based on C++, and
  it can be downloaded from SourceForge under GPL license terms.</p>

  <p>Noxim has a command line interface for defining several parameters of a NoC. In particular the
  user can customize the network size, buffer size, packet size distribution, routing algorithm,
  selection strategy, packet injection rate, traffic time distribution, traffic pattern, hot-spot
  traffic distribution.</p>

  <p>The simulator allows NoC evaluation in terms of throughput, delay and power consumption. This
  information is delivered to the user both in terms of average and per-communication results.</p>

  <p>In detail, the user is allowed to collect different evaluation metrics including the total number
  of received packets/flits, global average throughput, max/min global delay, total energy consumption,
  per-communications delay/throughput/energy etc.</p>

  <p>The Noxim simulator is shipped along with Noxim Explorer, a tool useful during the design space
  exploration phase. Infact, Noxim Explorer executes many simulations using Noxim in order to explore
  the design space, and modifying the configuration parameters for each simulation. Noxim Explorer will
  create new configuration parameters for you, or complete the exploration according to the information
  read from a script (known as exploration script or space file).</p>
